## Abstract

This document presents an overview of text processing algorithms with a focus on regular expression applications. Created on 15.03.2023, this research compiles findings from multiple studies conducted between 01/05/2022 and 12/31/2022.

## 1. Introduction

Text processing has become increasingly important in modern computing applications. From simple pattern matching to complex natural language processing, algorithms that efficiently handle textual data are essential components of many systems.

The first documented text processing algorithm dates back to 10/15/1968, though significant advancements weren't made until May 23, 1977.

## 2. Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) provide a powerful and flexible means for pattern matching and text manipulation. Developed by mathematician Stephen Kleene in the 1950s, they have become a standard feature in programming languages and text editors.

2.1 Basic Syntax

The core syntax elements include:
- Character classes: [a-z], [0-9]
- Quantifiers: *, +, ?, {n,m}
- Anchors: ^, $
- Groups: (...)

2.2 Applications

Common applications include:
- Data validation (emails, dates, phone numbers)
- Text parsing and extraction
- Search and replace operations
- Tokenization

Contact our regex experts at regex.help@programming-resources.net for implementation advice.

## 3. Performance Analysis

Our recent study (completed on 2023-04-30) compared different regex implementations:

| Engine | Simple Pattern (ms) | Complex Pattern (ms) | Memory Usage (MB) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Engine A | 12.5 | 45.7 | 8.3 |
| Engine B | 15.2 | 38.9 | 10.5 |
| Engine C | 9.8 | 52.3 | 7.2 |

Technical questions can be directed to performance@algorithm-testing.org or support@regex-benchmarks.com.

## 4. Case Studies

4.1 Email Extraction

A sample email extraction algorithm was tested on 06.12.2022 with these results:
- Accuracy: 98.5%
- False positives: 1.2%
- Processing speed: 15,000 emails/second

Test emails included standard formats (user@domain.com), subdomains (name@sub.domain.org), and complex cases (first.last+tag@company-name.co.uk).

4.2 Date Formatting

Our date standardization tool (version 2.3.1, released on 11-22-2023) supports multiple input formats:
- ISO: 2023-09-15
- European: 15.09.2023
- American: 09/15/2023
- Written: September 15, 2023

Contact dates@formatting-tools.net for custom format support.

## 5. Future Directions

Research planned for January 5, 2024 will focus on:
1. Neural network-based text processing
2. Optimization techniques for large-scale text analysis
3. Integration with natural language understanding systems

Funding provided by grant #CS-2023-0458 (awarded on 2023-02-10).

    """Extract dates in various formats from text"""
    patterns = [
        r'\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}',  # ISO format
        r'\d{1,2}\.\d{1,2}\.\d{4}',  # European format
